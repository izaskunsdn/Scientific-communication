I'm Izaskun Sedano, Biomedical Engeniering student at UPF and I'm publishing my first code.
My project is about searching for perfect numbers. Perfect numbers are so rare that actually we only know for 50 perfect numbers, although there are a lot more, I want to implement these code for searching them. These numbers have a huge importance in mathematics because they allow us to find the Marsenne prime numbers.
